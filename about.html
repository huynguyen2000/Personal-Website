                    Hi. My name is Huy Nguyen and I am currently a junior working on my computer science degree.
                    I was born in Vietnam and my family decided to immigrate to the US in 2007. When I was in high school,
                    I actually had no interest in the field of computer science. I remember not really knowing what I wanted to do
                    and was leaning towards the medical field. I had always been good with math and logic and so when I went
                    to college at TAMU, I declared my major as Biochemical Engineering since it involved both health and math. 
                    From there, it was actually the general engineering class that first introduced me to coding via Python, 
                    and ever since then, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I switched over to CS for my major and never looked back.
                    <br>
                    Some of my interests outside of coding consists mostly of games and playing guitar. I've been playing the
                    accoustic guitar for about 3-4 years now and I find that it's a really good way to pass the time and
                    destress. As for games, I enjoy a lot of strategy and card games and it's also a way for me to connect 
                    with my friends.

                    Future Plans
                </div>
                <div class="Text">
                    My short term plans is to finish my computer science degree and possibly pursue a masters in computer.
                    I am also actively looking for internship and co-op opportunities for the spring and summer of 2021.
                    As for my long term goals, I am still not sure what specific field I would like to work in yet. I have 
                    interests in machine learning, data science, web development, and more and I feel as if I have yet to 
                    explore all my options before being able to pin point down what I want to do in the future.
